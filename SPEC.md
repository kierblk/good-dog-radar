# Project Requirements

- [ ] The code should be written in ES6 as much as possible

- [ ] Use the `create-react-app` generator to start your project.
	- Follow the instructions on this repo to setup the generator: [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

- [ ] Your app should have one HTML page to render your react-redux application

- [ ] There should be 2 container components

- [ ] There should be 5 stateless components

- [ ] There should be 3 routes

- [ ] The Application must make use of `react-router` and proper RESTful routing (should you choose to use react-router v3 please refer to the appropriate [docs](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/v3/docs); docs for v4 can be found [here](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start))

- [ ] Use Redux middleware to respond to and modify state change

- [ ] Make use of async actions and `redux-thunk` middleware to send data to and receive data from a server

- [ ] Your Rails API should handle the data persistence with a database. You should be using `fetch()` within your actions to GET and POST data from your API - do not use
jQuery methods.

- [ ] Your client-side application should handle the display of data with minimal data manipulation

- [ ] Your application should have some minimal styling: feel free to stick to a framework (like react-bootstrap), but if you want to write (additional) CSS yourself, go for it!

- [ ] [Once your app is complete, fill out this checklist.](https://goo.gl/forms/ULtKsxuzWomvXuTk2)
