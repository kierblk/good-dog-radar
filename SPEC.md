# Spec for the Rails+React Assessment

## Overview

- [ ] The code should be written in ES6 as much as possible
- [x] Use the [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) generator to start your project
- [ ] Your app should have one HTML page to render your react-redux application

### Details

- [ ] There should be 2 container components.
- [ ] There should be 5 stateless components.
- [ ] There should be 3 routes.
- [ ] The Application must make use of `react-router` and proper RESTful routing.
- [ ] Use Redux middleware to respond to and modify state change.
- [ ] Make use of async actions and `redux-thunk` middleware to send data to and receive data from a server.
- [ ] Rails API backend that handles data persistence with a database. Use `fetch()` within your actions to `GET` and `POST` data from your API. Do not use jQuery methods.
- [ ] Your client-side application should handle the display of data with minimal data manipulation.
- [ ] Your application should have some minimal styling: react-bootstrap or hand-written are fine
- [ ] Once your app is complete, [fill out this checklist](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfX7qH_FqFqJ9vMMhtlHSYxhhafKJm8fe01IvsFNFitFC2nOA/viewform).
